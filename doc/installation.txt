* Modify [src/CMakeLists.txt] to specify the location of boost, lua, and luabind packages.
* Use standard CMake build process, e.g., mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; cmake --build .; ctest -C 
* Build process will create [syscore.so|dll]
* To use Nylon it is recommended to put syscore.so|dll in the [nylon] subdirectory and modify your package.path 
  and package.cpath to include the nylon location, so that "require 'nylon.core'" will import [nylon/core.lua]
  and "require 'nylon.syscore'" will import [nylon/syscore.so|dll].
  

Linux notes:

* Currently the linux build dumps syscore.so in [build/src]; I recommend copying this
  manually to the [nylon] subdirectory with [core.lua] but if you prefer the .so to
  be elsewhere just be sure your package.cpath is set correctly to find syscore.so
  when "require 'nylon.syscore'" is used.
