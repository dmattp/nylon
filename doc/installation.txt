All:

Run "git submodule init" and "git submodule update" to pull in luabind library.

standard CMake build process is normal; by convention (to match the nylabind
packages), I build into a <build> subdirectory or <build-win> subdirectory.

CMake sources attempt to locate the Lua54 package.  If you're not installed
in a standard location because you are e.g, on braindead windows with
whatever hack lua build you found or compiled yourself, you can define
LUA_INCLUDE_DIR and/or LUA_LIBRARIES on the cmake generation command line.

Running "cmake --install" after build should place lua and binary
modules int /usr/share/lua/5.4 or /usr/lib/lua/5.4.

You are of course free to install by hand any way you like.
